A React component for debugging and modifying CSS classes in real-time. Features include element inspection, selection, and adding predefined Tailwind CSS classes (`"text-balance"` and `"text-pretty"`).

MVP is a Chrome debug-like tool which allows for (my initial thoughts): toggle `text-wrap: balance` vs `normal` vs `pretty` to see how it looks like in the browser. Could be a standalone npm package or a Chrome extension.

- `Shift + X` to toggle debugger
- `Shift + X` again to turn off debugger
- Click on an element to see its class name
- Click on an element to add a class to it

WiP and will probably be forgotten.
